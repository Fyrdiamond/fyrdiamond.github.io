# Welcome
This is my website, with all sorts of information about me, things I'm doing, etc. It's also the hub for all my web based coding.

# Navigation
On each page in the website, you will find the header (in green), with links to the main parts of my website.

Additionally, there is a sidebar on each page that brings you to individual headers from that page.

# Creation
This website was originally created using Repl.it, a free online IDE. (with paid features as well).
